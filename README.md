Very simple ElasticSearch installation, based on the [official Elastic role](https://github.com/elastic/ansible-elasticsearch).

Role Variables

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: hernandesbsousa.elasticsearch }
